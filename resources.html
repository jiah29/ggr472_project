      <h2>About the Active Travel Initiative</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The goal of the Active Travel Initiative is to encourage more students in TDSB to commute to school using travel modes that are more active, safe, and sustainable, such as walking and cycling.</p>
      </div>
      <br>

      <h3>Why this initiative?</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>It is evident that since 1986, there have been increasing shifts away from active transportation, and currently around 63% of students use inactive modes of travel (i.e., private cars). This trend is worrying as there are several negative consequences to heavy reliance on inactive travel modes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of physical activity resulting in health issues</li>
            <div class="italicized">
              Currently, only 35% of Canadian children and youth, ages 5 - 17, achieve the recommended physical activity levels. Lack of exercises can increase risks of illnesses like obesity, cancer and type II diabetes.
            </div>
            <li>Increased use of private vehicles increase pollutants levels</li>
            <div class="italicized">
              More than one-third of Ontario’s greenhouse gasses come from vehicle emissions, and this exposure to air pollutants can result in respiratory health issues and reduce cognitive development among students. 
            </div>
            <li>Increased private vehicles make school zones more congested and less safe</li>
            <div class="italicized">
              Dangerous driver behaviors are observed at 88% of Toronto schools in a recent study, and each of these behaviors during school drop-off period was associated with 45% greater risk of collision.
            </div>
            <li>Traffic is a burden on school staff</li>
            <div class="italicized">
              Ontario’s school principals collectively spend an estimated 720,000 hours a year coping with traffic problems around their schools.
            </div>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br>

      <h3>Why active travel?</h3>

      <div class="paragraph">
          <ul>
              <li>Healthier Children</li>
              <div class="italicized">
                Active school travel can lead to increased physical activity that brings benefits such as lowering Body Mass Index and reducing stress, depression and anxiety. It can also build life-long benefits of independence and active mobility.
              </div>
              <li>Less traffic and pollution</li>
              <div class="italicized">
                Less reliance on private vehicles can improve air quality around school zones and reduce associated air-borne health risks. It can also help to support Ontario’s greenhouse gas reduction target of 80% by 2050.
              </div>
              <li>Safer school zones</li>
              <div class="italicized">
                Reducing traffic volume creates safer school zones and can enhance the connectivity and quality of life for the community.
              </div>
              <li>Better academic performance</li>
              <div class="italicized">
                Increased physical activity has been found to specifically associate with increased attention during the school day and can support healthy brain development, leading to improved learning.
              </div>
